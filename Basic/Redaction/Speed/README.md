# Preliminary Evaluation, Method Selection
## Correction
Each Basic dataset has six different test fields (e.g., O0O1, O0O2, O0O3, O1O2, O1O3, O2O3).
Since a program is inside 3 test fields, we perform three clone searches for each program.
Therefore, we have to measure three times the preprocessing of each program.
The total preprocessing running times of ASCG, ASCFG, PSS, and PSSO have been multiplied by 3.
